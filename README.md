# Uber_Analysis_Model
The Uber Taxi Fare Prediction model estimates ride costs based on two key features: miles traveled and ride purpose (business or personal). By analyzing the distance and categorizing the trip, the model predicts fares accurately. This approach helps Uber optimize pricing dynamically, providing users with transparent fare estimates for their trips.
